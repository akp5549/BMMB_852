ls
cd BMMB_852/BMMB_852/
mkdir week2
cd week2
```

### Download another file from Ensembl FTP server
``` 
wget https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gff3/ailuropoda_melanoleuca/Ailuropoda_melanoleuca.ASM200744v2.115.chr.gff3.gz
```

### Unzip file
```
gunzip
```

## 1. Tell us a bit about the organism.


## 2. How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? Does that match with the expectation for this organism?


## 3. How many features does the file contain?


## 4. How many genes are listed for this organism?


## 5. Is there a feature type that you may have not heard about before? What is the feature and how is it defined? (If there is no such feature, pick a common feature.)


## 6. What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?


## 7. Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?


## 8. Share any other insights you might note.
