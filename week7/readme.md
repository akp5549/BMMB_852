## Using the same MakeFile as last week I added the following changes:


## The 2 SRRs I compared:
```
make all SRR=SRR35257019 NAME=ebola-1976 ACC=AF086833 
make all SRR=SRR1972739 NAME=ebola-1976 ACC=AF086833 
```

# 1. Briefly describe the differences between the alignment in both files.

# 2.Briefly compare the statistics for the two BAM files.

# 3. How many primary alignments does each of your BAM files contain?

# 4. What coordinate has the largest observed coverage? (hint: samtools depth)

# 5. Select a gene of interest. How many alignments on the forward strand cover the gene?
